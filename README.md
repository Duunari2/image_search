# image_search

known issues are that the string where is contents of file is too long.

solve this issue by using only images to size 6kb or less size.

this is not tested artifactically but on run only.

to add: make instant redirect to anothersearchengine.com searchengine search instance when upload is ready.

to know: anothersearchengine.com does not have searchengine server because server costs. when get donations i can setup search engine to ready for use.
